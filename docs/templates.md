## Agent Kernel Templates

The project follows the Agent Kernel template system. For complete template documentation, see:

- **[Template Structure Guide](../docs/system-prompts/templates/structure.md)** - Standard templates for project plans, architecture decisions, and investigation reports

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Development Notes Directory

Development notes and session transcripts are stored in `dev_notes/` using the format:

1. **Executive Summary** - Overview and objectives
2. **Issues Summary** - Problems being addressed
3. **Implementation Phases** - Step-by-step breakdown
4. **Critical Files Summary** - Files to create, modify, or delete
5. **Verification Steps** - Testing and validation
6. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes
7. **Risk Mitigation** - Known risks and mitigation strategies
